# Recommendations for future contributions to the code base

  - Follow Python style naming and comments, don't invent your own
    naming scheme, see PEP-8
  - avoid cyclic module dependencies
  - avoid global state variables
  - test for multiple browsers and input formats
  - avoid comments that repeat what the function name should say anyways,
    instead try to find good, self-documenting names for functions, classes
    and modules
  - avoid Java-isms, there is no need to have a class for everything and there
    is nothing wrong about putting multiple small classes into a single file
